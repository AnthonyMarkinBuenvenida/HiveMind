# Automatic model routing

HiveMind picks a model for every message in **Auto** mode (the default). Users can still pick a model manually.

```
Browser ──▶ POST /api/chat { model: "auto" | <id>, … }
              │
              ▼
        server/api.mjs ── streams, timers, failover loop, SSE to the browser
              │
   ┌──────────┼──────────────────────────────┐
   ▼          ▼                              ▼
registry.mjs  router/                        providers/
 live model   classify.mjs  task + tier       gemini.mjs      (@google/genai)
 catalogs     route.mjs     filter + score    openrouter.mjs  (OpenAI-compatible)
 (+snapshot)  health.mjs    rolling health    upstream.mjs    UpstreamError
```

The browser never sees provider formats or keys: it sends `model: "auto"` (or an id) and receives the same event stream for every provider.

## 1. Model registry (`server/registry.mjs`)

Models are **discovered by rules** from the providers' live catalogs, refreshed hourly per server instance:

| Provider | Source | Included when |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini | `models.list` (needs the key) | a plain chat family (`gemini-X.Y-flash`, `-flash-lite`, `-pro`), newest generation only (`GEMINI_MIN_VERSION` to override), no Pro on the free tier (`GEMINI_TIER=paid` to include) |
| OpenRouter | `GET /api/v1/models` (public) | a `:free` text model with an Artificial Analysis intelligence index, not in `OPENROUTER_EXCLUDE`; plus `OPENROUTER_EXTRA_MODELS` (default: the two DeepSeek models) |

Each model is normalized to one shape: context window, max output, reasoning mode (`toggle`/`always`/`none`) and supported effort levels, vision, tools, streaming, price (what this deployment pays — Gemini's free tier counts as $0), and **quality = Artificial Analysis intelligence and coding indices** as published in OpenRouter's catalog (Gemini models are matched as `google/<id>`). Unknown quality stays `null`; nothing is invented.

`OVERRIDES` records behaviour verified against the real APIs that catalogs don't describe (e.g. North Mini Code garbles output with reasoning disabled, so it is `always`). If a catalog can't be fetched, `server/catalog-snapshot.mjs` (same rules, captured 2026-10-04) is used for that provider and the fetch is retried after 5 minutes. Tests use the snapshot (`MODEL_REGISTRY_LIVE=false`).

## 2. Classification (`server/router/classify.mjs`)

Deterministic — no model call. Signals from the latest user message (attachments are recognised by their `<file>` blocks): task type (simple, rewrite, summarization, structured, general, creative, coding, debugging, reasoning, math, data-analysis, long-document, multimodal), difficulty points (base per type + hard keywords such as *architecture, race condition, prove* + length + numbered requirements + large code blocks), and the estimated prompt size. Short follow-ups ("and in Go?") inherit the previous task.

| Tier | Points | Typical requests |
|---|---|---|
| fast | ≤ 1 | greetings, short questions and instructions, rewrites, short summaries |
| general | 2–3 | normal conversation, creative writing, typical coding, explanations |
| advanced | ≥ 4 | complex debugging, proofs, architecture, multi-step analysis |

## 3. Filtering (`server/router/route.mjs`)

A model is excluded when it can't take the request: no streaming; no image input for an image request; max output below `min(requested, 4096)`; context window smaller than prompt + that output + margin. Models cooling down after failures are skipped while others remain (if all are cooling, they are tried anyway — no dead end).

## 4. Scoring

Internal ranking only — never shown as a benchmark. Each component is 0–1; weights depend on the tier:

| Component | Meaning | fast | general | advanced |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| fit | benchmark quality vs. need (coding index for coding/debugging, intelligence otherwise), normalized to the best eligible model. Need: 0.5 / 0.75 / 1.0 of the best. Below need is penalized ×2; above need is penalized ×0.8 / ×0.3 / ×0 — so easy tasks get a smaller model and hard tasks the strongest | 0.45 | 0.55 | 0.65 |
| reliability | success rate in the health window, (ok+1)/(n+2) | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.15 |
| latency | measured time to first token vs. the fastest eligible model | 0.20 | 0.10 | 0.05 |
| cost | 1 for free, 1/(1 + $/M output) otherwise | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.05 |
| budget | share of OpenRouter's free daily requests left (`GET /key`) | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.10 |

Bonuses: +0.03 reasoning support for reasoning-heavy tasks, +0.02 when the model can write the full requested output, +0.05 for the previous answer's model on short follow-ups, and **+1 for Continue** (a continuation always stays on the model that wrote the answer, if it is eligible). Cost can't override capability: a model far below the need loses on `fit`. Ties break by registry order, so decisions are reproducible.

**Reasoning effort** follows the tier when thinking is on (fast → low, general → medium, advanced → high, mapped to the nearest level the model supports: Gemini `thinkingLevel`, OpenRouter `reasoning.effort`). With thinking off, a `toggle` model gets `off` (Gemini: its lowest level, `minimal`; OpenRouter: `reasoning.enabled: false`); an `always` model gets its lowest level.

## 5. Failover (`server/api.mjs`)

Candidates are tried in score order, at most `ROUTER_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (3) per request, never the same model twice. Each attempt has its own abort controller and a first-token timeout (`ROUTER_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, 45 s in Auto); the request-wide queue limit (`UPSTREAM_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) still applies.

- **Failover is only possible before anything reaches the browser.** The first event of a reply is awaited before the SSE headers are written; a failure up to that point moves to the next candidate. A failure after text has streamed ends the reply with an error (Retry/Continue), so answers are never mixed.
- Retried: 404/403 (model unavailable or restricted), 402 (needs credits), 429, 5xx/"high demand", timeouts, network errors, a stream that ends without a finish reason, and 400s (another model may accept the request, e.g. a context limit).
- A rejected key or unreachable provider excludes **that provider** for the rest of the request; OpenRouter's account-wide free quota (`free-models-per-day`) excludes its **free models**.
- Backoff (300 ms × 2ⁿ, ≤ 2 s) only before retrying the same provider after an overload.
- If nothing works, the error says which models were tried and why.

## 6. Health (`server/router/health.mjs`)

In memory per server instance; model ids, outcomes and timings only. Rolling window of 15 minutes (≤ 30 events per model). A failure starts a cooldown that doubles with consecutive failures (overload 20 s → 10 min cap; timeout 30 s; rate limit 60 s → 15 min; unavailable 6 h; needs credits 30 min); a success ends it. Provider-wide cooldowns: rejected key 10 min, free quota 30 min, unreachable 30 s. Health checks that find a rejected key cool that provider down immediately. `/api/models` reports each model as `ok`, `degraded` or `cooling` (shown as **Busy** in the picker).

On serverless hosts each instance learns on its own and starts fresh after a cold start.

## 7. Manual mode

A chosen model is used as-is: no silent replacement. If it fails, the error offers **Switch to Auto** (re-runs the message with the router). The setting *Fall back if my chosen model fails* (`allowFallback`) lets the router continue with other models; the reply then says the chosen model was unavailable.

## 8. What users see

Under each Auto reply: the model that answered and a small **Auto · Provider** chip that expands to one sentence — why that model (only claims "highest benchmark" when true) and which models were tried first. *Show routing details* (Settings → Chat, developer view) adds the full decision:

```
Request
→ Task type: coding (general tier) · coding
→ Requirements: ~16 prompt tokens, 4,000 output, ranked by coding benchmark
→ Eligible models: gemini-3.6-flash (0.95), deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro (0.861), …

```

No keys, message text or IP addresses are included.

## Adding a provider

1. Write `server/providers/<name>.mjs` exporting `{ id, label, vendor, keyEnv, configured(), check(modelId, signal), open({ model, messages, system, temperature, topP, maxTokens, effort, signal }) }`. `open` returns `{ maxTokens, events }` where `events` yields `reasoning`/`content`/`usage`/`error`/`finish`/`alive` events, and throws `UpstreamError(status, detail)` for provider failures.
2. Add its catalog to `registry.mjs` (a `buildModels` branch normalizing to the shared shape) and a snapshot entry.
3. Register it in `PROVIDERS` in `server/api.mjs`. The router, health tracking, failover and UI need no changes.

## Tests

`server/router.test.mjs` (classification, tiers on real snapshot data, filters, token limits, effort, health/recovery) and `server/routing.test.mjs` (end to end through `/api/chat` against a fake server playing both providers: outages, timeouts, rate limits, quota, failures before/after the first token, manual mode, max attempts, continuation, Stop).
